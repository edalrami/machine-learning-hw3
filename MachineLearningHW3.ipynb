The features include average yearly packaged financial aid, the number of years that the financial aid is awarded for, gender, marital status, marketing code, previous education, admission representative code, program code, citizenship code, ethnicity code, veteran code, and cancel flag code. Some of the students listed in the file cancelled their enrollment after meeting with Financial Aid. These students can be identified by the value of 1 in the cancel flag field.\n",
